<h1>Parent 360 Module</h1>

<p>Each training diary is linked to one 360 degree diagnostic module which is used to obtain information such as carried competencies and skills. If you are creating a new Training Diary then this field lists the name of the 360 module which the Training Diary will be linked to.</p>
<p>
This is a read-only field which is set automatically to the first 360 degree diagnostic on the course. If you wish to change which 360 degree diagnostic a training diary links to you will need assistance from a developer.</p>
